 DNN Face Detector in OpenCV
 This model was included in OpenCV from version 3.3. It is based on
 Single-Shot-Multibox detector (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)
 and uses ResNet-10 Architecture as backbone.
 The model was trained using images available from the web,
 but the source is not disclosed. OpenCV provides 2 models for this face detector.
 
 - Floating point 16 version of the original caffe implementation ( 5.4 MB )
 - 8 bit quantized version using Tensorflow ( 2.7 MB )
 
 Both models included in the code
